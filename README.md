# LTspice Basics
A set of simple simulation exercises to start using LTspice. These will be very helpful for first time users.

## Prerequisites
I have used LTspice XVII. Download the latest version of LTspice from their website to try out the simulations. I have uploaded a PDF of the steps to be followed for each simulation, and the final simulation file. The exercises are meant to be done in order for proper continuity.
